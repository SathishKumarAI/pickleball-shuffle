#  Pickleball Card Games

**Draw twist cards mid-match. Shake up the game.**

A free, **mobile-first, local-first** web app: 1,729 pickleball twist cards across 10 categories, fused with a real pickleball scorekeeper. Tap to draw a card, play the next point under that twist, and keep score - all on your phone, no login, no signal required after first load.

### ▶︎ Live app: **https://pickleball-card-games.vercel.app**

## Why local-first

This app deliberately has **no backend and no login** - a design decision, not a gap.

| Concern | Why local-first wins here |
|---|---|
| **Friction** | Players open the link mid-game; a signup wall loses them. |
| **Latency** | Drawing and scoring feel instant - no network in the hot path. |
| **Offline** | Courts have bad signal; a static site + service worker keeps working. |
| **Privacy & cost** | Your data never leaves the device; no DB, no auth, no per-user billing. |

Tradeoff: no cross-device sync. Custom decks and history live in `localStorage`, with a manual **Export / Import** backup to move data between devices.

## Highlights

- **1,729 unique cards** (the Ramanujan taxicab number), 10 categories, **5 deck modes** (Family → Chaos), plus **custom decks** you build yourself.
- **Card metadata** - every card has a **rarity** badge (common → legendary), an intensity rating, and tags. Most draws are common; a legendary is a moment.
- **Two text styles** - concise rules by default, or flip on **Commentator voice** in Settings for hyped courtside-caller flavour (both stored per card).
- **Real scorekeeper** - side-out scoring, win-by-2, serving indicator, undo, plus **in-game pause** (freezes the clock, survives reload).
- **Match length** - single game, best of 3, or best of 5, with a **match-complete celebration** when a team takes the series.
- **Resume last game**, **Match history**, **export/import backup** - all local, no account.
- **Mobile-tuned** - `100dvh`, safe-area insets, no iOS input zoom, a big **responsive card** with a Back button beside Draw, dark/light, sound + haptics, installable PWA.

## Features

Everything the app does, grouped so you can find it fast.

### 🃏 Cards & decks
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **1,729 unique cards** | Every card is one-of-a-kind (unique like a database key). The count is the Ramanujan "taxicab" number - tap the note on the home screen to see why. |
| **10 categories** | Shot Restriction, Body & Movement, Wild Card / Swap, Penalty, Bonus / Reward, Social & Party, Strategy / Skill, Wacky / Chaos, Court / Environment, Meta & Game-Flow. |
| **5 deck modes** | Family, Party, Drill, Tournament, Chaos - each filters the deck to fit the crowd. |
| **Rarity** | Each card has a badge: Common → Uncommon → Rare → Legendary (plus the original "Signature" set). Legendaries (Golden Zone, Overtime, big multipliers) are special moments. |
| **Two text styles** | Concise rules by default, or flip **Commentator voice** in Settings for hyped courtside-caller phrasing. Both are stored on every card. |
| **Custom decks** | Build and play your own deck of cards from the menu. |
| **Favorites** | Star cards you love and find them again under Favorite cards. |

### 🏓 Playing & scoring
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Real scorekeeper** | Side-out scoring, configurable points-to-win, win-by-2, serving indicator, one-tap undo, and a score lock to stop mis-taps. |
| **Draw twists** | Tap the card to draw a random twist for the next rally; a **Back** button sits right beside Draw for a quick exit. |
| **In-game pause** | Freeze the match clock and put scoring on hold; a Paused screen covers the board until you Resume. Survives closing the app. |
| **Match length** | Single game, best of 3, or best of 5 - with a **match-complete** celebration when a team takes the series. |
| **Resume last game** | Leave mid-match and a one-tap banner brings it back, card and score intact. |

### 💾 Your data (100% local)
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Match history** | Finished matches are saved automatically, on your device. |
| **Export / Import backup** | Move decks + history between devices via a JSON file - no account, no upload. |
| **Offline** | A service worker keeps it working at courts with bad signal. |

### 🧭 Learn & understand (no pickleball knowledge needed)
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Welcome tour** | On first open, a short swipeable tour: what the app is, how to play, and how to get around. Replayable from **Rules & help**. |
| **Tap-to-define jargon** | Terms on a card (dink, kitchen, erne, side-out…) are underlined - tap one for a plain-language definition. One shared glossary powers this and the Rules tab. |
| **Per-card "?" explainer** | Every card has a **?** that opens *what this means · how to play it · what kind of card* in beginner-friendly words. |
| **"What to do" line** | The card always shows a concrete "what to do this point", not just the constraint - plus a one-time in-game hint. |
| **"Why & how" help tab** | Rules & help opens on a benefits + navigation tab so a newcomer knows *why* to use it and *where* everything is. |

### 🏓 Coach / Umpire mode - "Track a match"
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **One-tap mode switch** | Home has a `Play with cards` / `Track a match` toggle - switch the whole flow any time, one tap. |
| **Match setup** | Singles or doubles, player/team names, an event/round label, points-to-win (11/15/21), match length, and cards on/off (off by default). |
| **Real server rotation** | Doubles uses the two-server rotation (Server 1 → 2 → side-out); the serving side + server number are shown live. Singles passes serve straight over. |
| **Officiating controls** | Per-team timeout and fault buttons, a side-out button, and the halfway side-switch reminder. |
| **Match sheet** | Saves to Match history with the event label + format; download a one-tap text **match sheet** (teams, game-by-game, timeouts, faults, duration) as proof of result. |

### 🎨 Feel & accessibility
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Polished motion** | 3D card flip, glassy panels, win confetti - all respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| **Accessible** | Keyboard focus rings, dialog semantics + Escape on every panel, screen-reader labels, 44px tap targets, and pinch-zoom left on. |
| **Themes & feedback** | Dark / light themes, sound effects, and haptics - all toggleable. |
| **Installable PWA** | "Add to Home Screen" and it runs like a native app. |

## Contributing

Contributions are genuinely welcome - whether it's a bug fix, a new card idea, or a feature.

- **Found a bug or have an idea?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/SathishKumarAI/pickleball-shuffle/issues/new) - even a one-liner helps. Screenshots and the device/browser are gold for layout bugs.
- **Want to send a change?**
  1. Fork the repo and create a branch (`feature/...` or `fix/...`).
  2. `cd app && npm install`, then `npm run dev` to develop.
  3. Before pushing: `npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build` (these are the CI gates).
  4. Open a PR describing the *why*. Keep it focused; conventional-commit titles (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`) appreciated.
- **Adding cards?** Edit `scripts/generate_cards.py` and re-run it (`python3 scripts/generate_cards.py`) so the deck stays unique and the metadata/dataset regenerate consistently.
- **New here?** Start with **[`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/ONBOARDING.md)** for a 3-minute setup and a map of the codebase.

There's no CLA and no red tape - just keep it local-first (no backend/login) and the build green.
